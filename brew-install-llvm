To use the bundled libc++ please add the following LDFLAGS:
  LDFLAGS="-L/opt/homebrew/opt/llvm@12/lib -Wl,-rpath,/opt/homebrew/opt/llvm@12/lib"

llvm@12 is keg-only, which means it was not symlinked into /opt/homebrew,
because this is an alternate version of another formula.

If you need to have llvm@12 first in your PATH, run:
  echo 'export PATH="/opt/homebrew/opt/llvm@12/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.zshrc

For compilers to find llvm@12 you may need to set:
  export LDFLAGS="-L/opt/homebrew/opt/llvm@12/lib -Wl,-rpath,/opt/homebrew/opt/llvm@12/lib"
  export CPPFLAGS="-I/opt/homebrew/opt/llvm@12/include"
